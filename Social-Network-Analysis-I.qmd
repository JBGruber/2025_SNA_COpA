# Introduction
## What are *graphs*?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column .fragment width="60%"}
### Mathematical Definition

A **graph** is a mathematical structure consisting of:

- **Vertices** (also called nodes or points)
- **Edges** (also called links or connections) that connect pairs of vertices

::: {.fragment}
### Think of it as...

- The mathematical "skeleton" or blueprint
- A formal way to represent relationships between things
- Abstract mathematical object with precise rules

#### Common pitfalls and problems

[@peixoto2021modularity; @peixoto2023descriptive; @peixoto2021hairball]{.nord-footer}

- (Implicitly?) believing some approaches are more "model-free" than others
- (Implicitly?) believing that network structure will be self-evident and our intuitions will hold up when reasoning about high-dimensional network structure

Which often translates to:

- using heuristic approaches [(esp. modularity-maximization)]{.nord-light} to partition/reduce networks
- interpreting generic network visualizations [(esp. force-directed)]{.nord-light} without sufficient model criticism

## Nope

**Pareidolia** (/ˌpærɪˈdoʊliə, ˌpɛər-/;[1] also US: /ˌpɛəraɪ-/)[2] is the tendency for perception to impose a meaningful interpretation on a nebulous stimulus, usually visual, so that one detects an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none.

::: {.column width="50%"}
- an essential topic in network analysis
- high-level goal is to simplify network structure by partitioning and [reducing]{.kn-pink} complex observed networks
- there are different kinds of structure and subgroups
- there are different methods and models we can use
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
**The reduction analogy**

- Starting with Complexity: Just as you begin cooking with a variety of ingredients in a sauce, you start with a complex network that has many nodes and edges representing different interactions or relationships.
- Reducing to Essentials: In cooking, reducing a sauce involves simmering it to evaporate excess liquid, concentrating the flavors, and focusing on the essential ingredients. Similarly, blockmodeling simplifies the network by grouping similar nodes into blocks or communities, thereby reducing the complexity of the network and focusing on the essential structural patterns.
- Enhancing Understanding: The goal of reducing a sauce is to create a richer, more flavorful dish that enhances the overall meal. Likewise, the goal of blockmodeling is to create a clearer, more understandable representation of the network, making it easier to identify key patterns, relationships, and structures.
- Striking the Right Balance: Just as you must be careful not to reduce a sauce too much (which could lead to an overly intense or burnt flavor), in blockmodeling, it’s important to strike the right balance between simplification and preserving the network’s meaningful structure. Over-simplification could result in loss of important details.

- there are different kinds of structure and subgroups
  - assortative-connective, equivalent-positional
- there are different methods and models we can use
  - **heuristic-descriptive**
    - have been popular for some time
    - are deeply flawed and should be avoided
  - **generative-inferential**
    - not new [[e.g., @holland1983stochastic; @snijders1997estimation; @bearman2004chains]]{.nord-light}, better and more accessible than ever
    - strong opinion: must become be the standard

### Heuristic Community Detection<br>via Modularity Maximization

<br><br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

The Louvain [[@blondel2008fast]]{.nord-light} algorithm purports to detect communities in networks by maximizing a "modularity" score $Q$ [[@newman2004finding]]{.nord-light}, where higher $Q$ values indicate more modular networks.

::: {.notes}
It starts by assuming that every node in a network is in it's own community and calculates a modularity score $Q$ for the network. Nodes are then randomly moved into different groups and $Q$ is re-calculated. If it increased, the community assignment is retained. This process continues until the node assignments have maximized $Q$ at the level of the observed network.

Next, a simplified network is created by aggregating nodes into their assigned communities and the modularity maximization process is repeated. Communities are merged with other communities, and the mergers are retained if $Q$ increases. This process continues iteratively until $Q$ has been maximized.

Some **well-known problems**:

- the resolution limit
- getting stuck in local optima
- creating disconnected communities
- can only identify assortative structure
- finds "communities" in random networks
- the illusion of greater objectivity<br>[[see @moody2023cohesion]]{.nord-footer}
- simultaneously over- and under-fit<br>[[see @peixoto2023descriptive]]{.nord-footer}
- often has a degenerate solution space<br>[[see @peixoto2023descriptive]]{.nord-footer}
- etc.

[There have been some improvements to modularity-maximization approaches [[e.g., @traag2019louvain]]{.nord-light}, but these only go so far. There are **fundamental problems** with the modularity-maximization idea, and heuristic approaches in general.]{.fragment}

There are well-known problems with the Louvain algorithm, including **the resolution limit**, which prevents Louvain from detecting meaningful small communities due to inappropriate merging at higher levels. Louvain can also get **stuck in local optima**, causing it to stop looking for better partitions because it "thinks" (incorrectly) that $Q$ has been maximized. And sometimes it **creates disconnected communities**!
